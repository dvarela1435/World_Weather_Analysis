# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview
This project is a build up from a beta test. 

## Retrieve Weather Data
Using a previous code, I refactored this code to include weather descriptions

## Create a Customer Travel Destination Map
As an add on to this code, I included destinations tha are a temperature between 65 to 80 degrees temperature.

The map includes markers with the following information:
- Hotel Name
- City
- Country
- Current Weather which includes weather description and temperatures


## Create a Travel Itenerary Map
The final process is to include a travel route for people who would like to travel between 4 different cities with a timeframe and visit the hotels in the area.  

The map will include the following,
- Hotel Name
- City
- Country
- Current Weather which includes weather description and temperatures
